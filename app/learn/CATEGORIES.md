# 10 Major YouTube Playlist Categories

## Overview

This document outlines the 10 major categories for YouTube playlists, organized hierarchically from major ideas down to individual species. Each category represents a "big idea" with potential for 100M+ views and the ability to generate 100+ related videos.

## The Hierarchy

**Major Category** → **Sub-Category** → **Individual Species**

For example:
- **Spinosaurus** (Major Category)
  - **Spinosaurus: The Flagship Species** (Sub-Category)
    - accurate-spinosaurus, spinosaurus-2021, spinosaurus-aquatic (Individual Species)

## Strategy

### Why These Categories?

Each category is designed as a "big idea" that can anchor a major YouTube playlist. The flagship species represents the most compelling entry point - the video that could reach 100M+ views with exceptional CGI and storytelling.

### Content Expansion

Sub-categories allow for thematic organization within each major playlist, enabling viewers to explore related topics while maintaining engagement. This structure supports both binge-watching and targeted discovery.

### Video Potential

The estimated video count represents the potential for long-form content creation, with each species, discovery, theory, and ecological relationship offering opportunities for deep-dive episodes.

### Growth Strategy

- Start with the flagship species video (highest view potential)
- Expand into sub-categories to maintain engagement
- Create series within sub-categories (e.g., "Evolution of Spinosaurids")
- Cross-reference between categories (e.g., "Spinosaurus vs. Megalodon")
- Cover new discoveries as they emerge
- Explore scientific debates and controversies
- Create "versus" and comparison videos
- Deep-dive into specific adaptations and behaviors

## Additional Categories (Future Expansion)

These categories could expand into major playlists as content grows:

11. **Sauropod Dinosaurs** (Dreadnoughtus, Dicraeosaurus, etc.)
12. **Ornithischian Dinosaurs** (Stegosaurs, Ankylosaurs, etc.)
13. **Early Reptiles & Synapsids**
14. **Invertebrates** (Meganeura, Giant African Millipede, etc.)
15. **Jurassic Park Accuracy Series**
